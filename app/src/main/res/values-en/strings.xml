<string name="about_app_long1">An app for those who have secrets...</string>
<string name="about_app_long2">The app captures and stores photos in encrypted form. Images are not accessible to the gallery and other apps.
    Access to the app is password-protected and disguised as a music app. Images saved using encryption cannot be
    read without the key, even if the file is extracted from the phone. Security concept: all data is stored only on the users device,
    no server-side storage of user images, previews, keys, passwords is applied. However, the user can share images in both encrypted
    and decrypted forms. Receive images from other users and decrypt them using a similar encryption key.</string>
<string name="about_app_long3">Data storage features:</string>
<string name="about_app_long4">- Previews are stored in the internal app directory with the extension .p and are not encrypted. The preview scale in pixels
    can be selected in Settings from 1x1 px to 100x100 px.
\n\n
- Original images are stored in the internal app directory. When encryption is used, the file is saved with the extension .kk. If
    the user chooses not to use encryption, the file is saved with the extension .o. When the user shares a decrypted image, a temporary file
    with the extension .peekaboo is created. In this form, the file can be sent by any means available to the device. Once the user closes the view window
    of this image, the decrypted copy is deleted from the device. That is, encrypted images are only stored in encrypted form. The user can change the
    encryption settings through the Settings menu.
\n\n
- The encryption key and password are stored on the device in a secure form. For security reasons, there is no way to recover the key and password.
    If you forget the password to log into the app, the best solution is to uninstall and reinstall the app. In case of loss of the encryption key,
    you can create another key without reinstalling the app, however, images saved with the old key will not be accessible for viewing. Clear the
    image storage, change the key or password through the Settings menu.</string>
<string name="about_app_long5">Encryption System Features</string>

    <string name="about_app_long6">The app has three encryption modes:\n\n
1. NO ENCRYPTION. Saving files without entering an encryption key ‚Äì files are stored on the device in a format inaccessible to other apps and the gallery, but
        an attacker can extract and read them if they gain access to the device. When a file sent from the device is received, its contents can be read.
\n\n
2. CONSTANT ENCRYPTION KEY (optimal option). The user comes up with or generates an encryption key. The key is used to encrypt the file according to
        the Advanced Encryption Standard. The file is stored on the device in an encrypted form, and even with access to the devices memory (or with a
        received encrypted file from the device), an attacker cannot read the contents without the encryption key. The key is stored in the app in a
        secure hashed form. The user can create and store up to three keys in the app.
\n\n
3. VARIABLE ENCRYPTION KEY. If the user checks the "Do not save encryption key" option, the key will not be stored in the app and will be requested each time
        when entering. The key exists in the app only while it is open. The highest level of security; however, if you forget the old key, files previously
        saved with this key will not be accessible for viewing. In the Settings menu, you can always change security options.</string>

    <string name="how_does_the_key_works_details">ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD\n\nThe apps function implements the encryption algorithm for images using
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
This algorithm uses a symmetric key and applies the AES standard to ensure the security of the image during transmission or storage. \n\n
General process:\n- Creating and extracting the master key from the app for use as the basis for creating the encryption key;\n
- Applying the SHA hash function to the master key to obtain a fixed-length key;\nUsing the key to initialize the cipher object using
the AES algorithm;\n- Encrypting data from the source stream using AES;\n- Encrypted data is written to the output file;
\n- Closing the streams.\n\nHash function SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm). Here are some key characteristics:\n- Hash length. SHA produces a hash value
of fixed length (for security purposes, the length of the hash value is not disclosed).\n- Collision resistance. SHA provides a high level of collision resistance.
Collisions occur when two different input messages generate the same hash value. For SHA, collisions may be theoretically possible, but their
occurrence requires a huge amount of computational resources.\n- The apps master key is used as the basis for creating the encryption key. To bring
the master key to a fixed length, SHA is applied. This ensures that regardless of the length of the original master key, the result will be a hash
of fixed length that can then be used as the encryption key.</string>
